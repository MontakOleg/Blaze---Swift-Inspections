This project is for creating a plugin which will add support for multiple inspections inside the AppCode

Currently supported inspections:
- Missing documentation for public methods
- Missing documentation for classes 
- Unsorted enum cases
- Empty methods
- Unused methods
- Methods which are calling super only
- Unused parameters from function declaration
- Unused classes
- Unused class instance variable

Current supported inspections with limited funtionality:
- Add to constructor instance variables - it adds to constructor but not the initialization
